1. The bug was that the two nums (num1 and num2) were taken as string and so summing them up will result in concatenation of the strings containing the numbers, causing the resulted answer to be as such as well (concatenated string).
2. The fix is very simple: instead of string operations, we want an integer one. As such, we can use parseInt() fumction for the two nums, making them integers, and making the operation summation and not concatenation: the correct one. The detail is on the screenshot [fix.png](~/expand/screenshots/fix.png).
